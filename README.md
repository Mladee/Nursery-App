This app was designed to make predictions on the Nursery Dataset with an accuracy of over 99%(I have used the CatBoost Classifier).This project contains the static folder, which contains the style.css file, the templates folder, which contains the 2 html files, app.py, which is the main part of the project which uses Flask, model.py, where I built the model starting from the already-encoded dataset(the feature engineering has been made in the Jupyter file), and the FinalData which is the csv containing the final data.I hope you enjoy my project and thank you for visiting ^.^
